 <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #2193b0;font-size: 28px;">Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 12, 2025</p>

    <p>This Agreement sets the terms for dog training services provided by BarkNBondK9Solutions, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“we,” “our,” or “Company”), to the client (“Client”) who signs below or books services. By scheduling or taking part in our training, the Client acknowledges that they have read, understand, and agree to these terms.</p>

    <p>These Terms and Conditions apply to all services offered by the Company including but not limited to single sessions, virtual training, training programs, and multi-session packages. Any individual service descriptions or listings—whether on the Company’s website, booking page, or marketing materials—are subject to and governed by the terms outlined in this Agreement. In the event of any discrepancy between those descriptions and this Agreement, these Terms shall prevail.</p>

    <h3>1. Description of Services</h3>
    <p>The Company provides private, in-home, virtual, and public-area dog training services, customized to meet the specific needs and requirements of each individual dog, with public sessions held only where permitted.</p>

    <h4>(1a) Training Philosophy, Tools &amp; Treats</h4>
    <p>We follow a positive-based, science-backed approach to dog training that emphasizes trust, clear communication, and the reinforcement of desirable behaviors. Our goal is to strengthen the human-canine bond through proven, humane training techniques.</p>
    <p>While our foundation is rooted in positive reinforcement, we recognize that certain training tools—such as E-collars—can be used responsibly with professional guidance and for non-aversive communication purposes only. The aversive (shock) feature of E-collars is not used in our training. Tools are introduced and demonstrated only when appropriate, and always in a way that supports the wellbeing of the dog.</p>
    <p>Clients may request the use of specific training tools or equipment, but they will only be used if approved at the sole discretion of Our trainers as safe, ethical, and appropriate for the individual dog. If a tool is not approved, it will not be used, but this will not result in termination of services.</p>
    <p>Training treats are provided by the Company during sessions. The exact treats used will be disclosed on the Dog Training Assessment Form. If a dog has any food allergies, sensitivities, or medical conditions, this must be disclosed on the same form prior to booking.</p>

    <h3>2. Session Duration</h3>
    <p>Each training session lasts approximately as stated in the booking description or as otherwise agreed upon in writing. Additional time may incur extra charges.</p>

    <h3>3. Booking, Payment &amp; Cancellation</h3>

    <h4>(3a) Payment Requirements</h4>
    <p>A valid credit card is required to confirm bookings. We may charge this card for services rendered, late cancellations, no-shows, or applicable fees.</p>

    <h4>(3b) Cancellation Policy</h4>
    <p>Cancellations with less than 24 hours’ notice will incur a $51.84 late cancellation fee. No-shows are charged the same fee. After three cancellations or no-shows, future services may be terminated without refund.</p>

    <h4>(3c) Refund Policy</h4>
    <p>Refunds, if applicable, are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Single sessions: 25% refund up to the first three sessions.</li>
      <li>Packages/programs: 25% refund within the first six sessions or before program completion, whichever comes first.</li>
      <li>All virtual sessions (including single sessions, packages, and programs) are non-refundable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All refund requests must be submitted in writing and will be processed within 14 business days, minus any applicable fees.</p>

    <h4>(3d) Pricing Changes</h4>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, update, or adjust service pricing at any time in response to changes in operational costs, service offerings, or third-party processing fees. Clients will be notified of any pricing changes via email or updates posted on the Company’s official website prior to the effective date of such changes as they relate to future services. Prices confirmed at the time of booking shall remain valid for that specific appointment, unless otherwise stated in writing by the Company.</p>

    <h3>4. Required Documentation</h3>
    <p>Clients must submit all required forms within 24 hours of first notice. Sessions remain tentative until forms are reviewed and approved. Failure to submit forms on time may result in cancellation. If payment was made and the session is canceled for missing forms, a full refund will be issued.</p>

    <h3>5. Rescheduling Policy</h3>
    <p>Clients may reschedule up to three times with at least 24 hours’ notice. Additional changes require written approval. Exceptions may be made for documented medical emergencies or at the Company discretion. Excessive rescheduling may lead to service termination.</p>

    <h3>6. Late Arrival</h3>
    <p>Trainers will wait up to 15 minutes past the scheduled time. If the Client does not arrive or show up within this window, the session is forfeited, and the no-show fee applies.</p>

    <h3>7. Participation and Compliance</h3>
    <p>Client agrees to actively participate, follow training instructions, and promptly report concerns or changes in behavior. Failure to comply may result in discontinued services without refund.</p>

    <h3>8. Termination by the Company</h3>
    <p>Services may be terminated immediately for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Non-payment;</li>
      <li>Repeated breaches of this Agreement;</li>
      <li>Unsafe or inappropriate behavior by Client or dog.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No refunds will be provided upon termination under these circumstances.</p>

    <h3>9. Assumption of Risk &amp; Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>Client acknowledges the inherent risks in dog training and assumes full responsibility for any injury, damage, or outcomes. To the fullest extent permitted by law, BarkNBondK9Solutions, LLC, its owners, trainers, contractors, and agents shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from the services, whether during or after training.</p>

    <h3>10. Indemnification</h3>
    <p>Client agrees to indemnify and hold harmless BarkNBondK9Solutions, LLC, its owners, trainers, contractors, and agents from all claims, liabilities, damages, or expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Client’s breach of this Agreement;</li>
      <li>The behavior or actions of Client’s pet;</li>
      <li>Client’s failure to follow instructions or precautions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>11. Insurance</h3>
    <p>The Company carries professional liability insurance, which does not cover damages caused by Client negligence or misconduct. Clients are encouraged to carry pet insurance.</p>

    <h3>12. Conduct Policy</h3>
    <p>Clients must behave toward the Company staff, animals, and members of the public in a respectful, safe, and appropriate manner at all times, regardless of location. Any behavior that is abusive, aggressive, harassing, threatening, or otherwise unsafe—whether verbal or physical—will result in the immediate termination of services without refund and permanent disqualification from all future bookings.</p>
    <p>The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to determine what constitutes inappropriate conduct and to take immediate action, including discontinuing services on-site and reporting the incident to relevant authorities when necessary.</p>

    <h3>13. Trainer Identification</h3>
    <p>All trainers are background-checked and carry official company identification. Proof of insurance and required permits are also available upon request.</p>

    <h3>14. Confidentiality &amp; Media Use</h3>
    <p>All personal and pet information is strictly confidential. Paper forms are digitized and securely destroyed within 30 days from the date of signature. Client photos or videos may be used for marketing purposes only with written consent.</p>

    <h3>15. Parking Authorization</h3>
    <p>Clients authorize trainers to park only in legal, permitted areas on or near their property, including guest spaces, HOA-approved zones, or public parking where allowed. Regardless of whether the parking area is permitted, the Company is not responsible for any parking violations, towing, or fees incurred, and such charges may be billed to the Client.</p>

    <h3>16. Non-Payment &amp; Collections</h3>
    <p>Fees must be paid as invoiced. Non-payment may lead to service suspension, collections, or legal action. Clients are responsible for all recovery costs, including attorney and court fees.</p>

    <h3>17. Location Sharing &amp; Mileage Tracking</h3>
    <p>Trainers will share their real-time location approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. Mileage related to in-person training is tracked for business and tax purposes and is handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h3>18. Service Area, Licensure &amp; Service Restrictions</h3>
    <p>The Company is a registered business operating in Miami-Dade County, Florida, offering mobile and virtual dog training services throughout Miami-Dade, as permitted by applicable local laws. Training sessions are conducted at the Client’s designated location, in permitted public spaces, or virtually, as mutually agreed upon in advance.</p>
    <p>The Company does not provide transportation services for dogs or clients under any circumstances. The company does not operate, nor is it licensed to operate, any kennel, boarding, daycare, or pet transportation service. Clients are solely responsible for transporting their pets and for their care outside of scheduled training sessions.</p>

    <h3>19. Modifications</h3>
    <p>The Company may propose updates to this Agreement from time to time. Any such updates or changes will require the Client’s written acceptance via a new contract or addendum. Continued use of services without signing the updated agreement does not constitute acceptance of modified terms. If the Client does not accept the updated Agreement, current terms remain in effect.</p>

    <h3>20. Governing Law &amp; Jurisdiction</h3>
    <p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. Any legal action or proceeding arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Miami-Dade County, Florida, and the parties hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts.</p>

    <h3>21. Severability</h3>
    <p>If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of law, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

    <h3>22. Waiver</h3>
    <p>Failure by the Company to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of its rights to do so in the future.</p>

    <h3>23. Force Majeure</h3>
    <p>The Company shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, government actions, or other unforeseen events.</p>

    <h3>24. Electronic Signature</h3>
    <p>Client agrees that electronic signatures and electronic records shall be considered legally binding and equivalent to original signatures.</p>

    <h3>25. Entire Agreement</h3>
    <p>This document, together with any signed addenda or updates, constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements, whether written or oral. No modifications or amendments are valid unless signed in writing by both the Client and an authorized representative of the Company.</p>

    <h3>26. Dispute Resolution</h3>
    <p>In the event of any dispute, claim, or disagreement arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the services provided, both the Client and BarkNBondK9Solutions, LLC agree to attempt to resolve the matter through good faith negotiations.</p>
    <p>If a resolution cannot be reached informally, both parties agree to submit the dispute to mediation in Miami-Dade County, Florida, before pursuing any other legal remedy. Mediation shall be conducted by a mutually agreed-upon neutral third party. The cost of mediation shall be shared equally by both parties.</p>
    <p>If mediation fails to resolve the issue, either party may then pursue legal action as permitted under Section 20 (Governing Law &amp; Jurisdiction). However, both parties agree to waive their right to a jury trial and instead submit to a bench trial in the applicable court.</p>
    <p>Nothing in this clause shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief or other equitable remedies for urgent matters.</p>

    <h3>Acknowledgment (For Display Purposes Only)</h3>
    <p>These Terms and Conditions are provided for review. All Clients are required to read, understand, and sign this Agreement prior to the commencement of any services with BarkNBondK9Solutions, LLC.</p>

  },
  {
    q: "How do you handle aggressive dogs?",
    a: "Safety is our top priority. We assess each dog’s behavior carefully and tailor training accordingly. In some cases, we may recommend additional professional evaluation or referrals to specialists to ensure the best outcome."
  },
  {
    q: "What if my dog has health issues?",
    a: "Please disclose any health conditions before training begins. We will modify sessions as needed and may require veterinary clearance to ensure your dog’s safety."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer guarantees for training results?",
    a: "Every dog is unique, so we can’t guarantee specific outcomes. However, we commit to providing effective, compassionate training and ongoing support to help you succeed."
  },
  {
    q: "How do you charge for travel or extra time?",
    a: "Our pricing reflects the training session length. For travel outside our standard service area or extended sessions, additional fees may apply. We’ll always communicate these clearly upfront."
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I’m unhappy with a trainer?",
    a: "We want you to feel comfortable and confident. If you have concerns about your trainer, please let us know promptly so we can address the issue or arrange for another trainer if possible."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer payment plans?",
    a: "Yes, we offer payment plans through Affirm, Klarna, and Afterpay for all in-person programs, packages, and single sessions. These options allow you to pay over time with ease. Virtual sessions are not eligible for payment plans. If you’re booking directly online and don’t see the payment plan option, just contact us — we’ll issue an invoice so you can activate the plan through your preferred service."
  },
  {
    q: "I’m interested in training my dog to become a service dog — can you help with that?",
    a: "While we understand the importance of service dogs and the role they play, BarkNBondK9Solutions does not offer task-specific training required for service dogs under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\n\nWe can help with foundational skills like obedience, leash manners, and general behavior — which are important for any well-trained dog. However, participating in our training programs DOES NOT qualify your dog as a service dog.\n\nTo be considered a service dog under the ADA, a dog must be individually trained to perform tasks directly related to a person’s disability. There’s no official certification required by the ADA, but specific task training is essential — and that’s not something we currently provide.\n\nIf your goal is to train your dog for full service dog work, we recommend connecting with a trainer or organization that specializes in ADA-compliant task training. In the meantime, we’re happy to support you with the basic skills your dog will need along the way.\n\nFor more details on service animals and ADA guidelines, visit: <a href='https://www.ada.gov/resources/service-animals-2010-requirements/' target='_blank'>https://www.ada.gov/resources/service-animals-2010-requirements/</a>"
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer protection dog training?",
    a: "BarkNBondK9Solutions does not offer protection, guard, or bite work training. Our approach is focused on positive reinforcement and trust-building to help dogs become well-mannered, confident, and reliable companions.\n\nProtection and bite work require highly specialized training and carry significant legal and safety responsibilities. We recommend that individuals interested in personal protection training seek out certified professionals who operate within strict ethical and legal standards.\n\nOur programs are designed to help dogs with strong instincts channel their energy into obedience, confidence, and calm responsiveness."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you provide services outside of the home, like at a park or other public location?",
    a: "Yes, we do offer services outside the home, including at parks and other agreed-upon public locations, depending on the type of service and weather conditions."
  },
  {
    q: "What is an e-collar and how does it work?",
    a: "An e-collar, or electronic collar, is a remote communication tool that delivers a low-level, adjustable stimulation—comparable to a light tap—to help gain and maintain a dog’s attention. It is not used as a form of punishment or to induce fear.\n\nThe e-collar is an optional training tool introduced only when appropriate and always under professional guidance. For dogs 5 months and older, it can be a valuable part of a thoughtful, trust-based training approach—enhancing communication, clarity, and off-leash reliability."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I have my dog registered as an emotional support animal (ESA)?",
    a: "Emotional Support Animals (ESAs) provide comfort and emotional support to individuals with mental or emotional conditions, but they are not the same as service dogs and do not require specialized task training.\n\nA dog can be recognized as an ESA if a licensed mental health professional determines that the animal is part of your treatment plan and provides you with an ESA letter. This letter serves as documentation of your need for an ESA under certain legal protections.\n\nAt BarkNBondK9Solutions, we DO NOT provide ESA evaluations, letters, or registrations. However, if you have an ESA and are looking to improve your dog’s behavior, obedience, or general manners, we’re happy to support you with those training needs."
  },
  {
    q: "What if my dog seems worse after training?",
    a: "It’s not uncommon for dogs to push boundaries or act out in new ways as they adjust to the training process. This doesn’t mean the training isn’t working — it often means your dog is learning and adapting. We’re here to guide you through this stage and help get things back on track."
  },
  {
    q: "What if I followed the plan and still don’t see results?",
    a: "We understand how frustrating that can be. Every dog learns differently, and sometimes progress takes longer than expected. Let us know what’s going on — we’ll review your training plan, troubleshoot any issues, and make adjustments to support better outcomes."
  },
  {
    q: "Can training make my dog more anxious or aggressive?",
    a: "Not with the methods we use. Our training is reward-based, force-free, and designed to build trust and confidence. If your dog seems more stressed or reactive, we’ll take a step back, assess the situation, and adjust the approach as needed."
  },
  {
    q: "What if I don’t have time to keep up with the training at home?",
    a: "We know life gets busy. Consistency helps, but we’ll work with you to develop a plan that fits your schedule. Even just a few focused minutes a day can make a big difference when used effectively."
  },
  {
    q: "Is this training just temporary? Will the results fade over time?",
    a: "Training builds habits — and habits need maintenance. With regular practice, the results can absolutely last. We’ll give you the tools and knowledge to keep your dog’s progress going long after your sessions are done."
  },
  {
    q: "What if I’ve already worked with other trainers and nothing helped?",
    a: "That’s more common than you might think, and we’re here for a fresh start. We’ll take time to understand your dog’s history, your goals, and what hasn’t worked — and build a customized approach from there."
  },
  {
    q: "Will you still work with my dog if it has a bite history or has been labeled “aggressive”?",
    a: "Yes, we work with many dogs who have complex behavior histories. Safety is always our priority, and we may begin with a behavior consultation to better understand your dog’s triggers and thresholds. Our goal is progress — not perfection — and we’re committed to helping where we can."
  },
  {
    q: "What if I can’t afford to keep booking sessions — will it still be worth it?",
    a: "Definitely. Even a few well-planned sessions can equip you with valuable skills and insight. We focus on giving you tools you can use every day, even if your training time is limited. When you’re ready for more, we’ll be here."
  },
  {
 q: "I see that the LLC is new. Why is that?",
  a: "While BarkNBondK9Solutions is a newly formed LLC, the trainer behind the name has been offering professional mobile dog training services for years. The LLC was created to formalize the business structure and support the exciting next phase—opening a dedicated training facility. In the meantime, services remain fully mobile, with the same trusted expertise and care clients have always received."
